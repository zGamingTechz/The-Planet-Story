## 📖 About

**The Planet Files** is a web app that presents short, character-based stories for each planet in the solar system. While not interactive (yet), it focuses on delivering a blend of science and narrative through a clean UI and subtle background music.

Users can click through each planet's story and get a feel for its "personality" based on its astronomical facts and imagined traits.
